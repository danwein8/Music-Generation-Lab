# Music-Generation-Lab
Uses a Recurrent Neural Network that keeps track of previous predictions, this influences future predictions, thereby giving RNN's a temporal dimension.
There is the copy of the MIT Deep Learning Lab and the Jupyter Notebook that I am attempting to transfer it over to so I can build my own model with ABC
files that I find online.
